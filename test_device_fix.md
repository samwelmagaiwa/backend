# Device Inventory ICT Approval Fix - Test Guide

## Bug Description
- **Problem**: ICT approval requests were showing devices that are no longer available in the device inventory
- **Root Cause**: The `deviceInventory` relationship in ICT approval was not filtering for active devices only

## Fix Implementation

### Backend Changes

1. **ICTApprovalController.php** - Enhanced device inventory relationship loading:
   - Modified `deviceInventory` eager loading to only fetch active devices
   - Updated `getDeviceDisplayName()` method to handle deleted/inactive devices
   - Added proper status indicators for unavailable devices

2. **Enhanced Device Display Logic**:
   - Shows actual inventory device name when available and active
   - Shows "(Device No Longer Available)" for inactive devices
   - Shows "(Device No Longer in Inventory)" for deleted devices
   - Falls back to device type mapping for custom/other devices

### Frontend Changes

3. **RequestsList.vue** - Added visual indicators:
   - Device column now shows warning for unavailable devices
   - Red warning text with icon for deleted/inactive devices

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Normal Available Device
- **Setup**: Create a device in inventory, create a booking request for it
- **Expected**: Device name shows normally from inventory
- **Verify**: No warning indicators shown

### Test Case 2: Inactive Device
- **Setup**: Create a device, create booking, then set device to `is_active = false`
- **Expected**: Device shows as "DeviceName (Device No Longer Available)"
- **Verify**: Warning indicator shown in frontend

### Test Case 3: Deleted Device
- **Setup**: Create device, create booking, return device, then delete device from inventory
- **Expected**: Device shows as "DeviceType (Device No Longer in Inventory)"
- **Verify**: Warning indicator shown in frontend

### Test Case 4: Custom Device
- **Setup**: Create booking with device_type = 'others' and custom_device name
- **Expected**: Shows custom device name
- **Verify**: No inventory relationship, normal display

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Available Device**:
   ```sql
   -- Check device inventory
   SELECT id, device_name, is_active FROM device_inventory WHERE is_active = 1;
   
   -- Check ICT approval requests
   SELECT id, device_type, device_inventory_id FROM booking_service WHERE device_inventory_id IS NOT NULL;
   ```

2. **Test Inactive Device**:
   ```sql
   -- Set device as inactive
   UPDATE device_inventory SET is_active = 0 WHERE id = [device_id];
   
   -- Check ICT approval response shows proper warning
   ```

3. **Test Deleted Device**:
   ```sql
   -- Delete device (ensure no active bookings first)
   DELETE FROM device_inventory WHERE id = [device_id];
   
   -- Verify ICT approval handles null relationship gracefully
   ```

## API Testing

### Test ICT Approval Endpoint
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/booking-service/ict-pending-approvals" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "data": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "device_name": "Projector Model X",
        "device_available": true,
        "device_inventory_id": 5
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "device_name": "Laptop Dell (Device No Longer Available)",
        "device_available": false,
        "device_inventory_id": 3
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Data Integrity**: ICT approvals now reflect real inventory status
2. **Clear Communication**: Users see when requested devices are no longer available
3. **Audit Trail**: Historical requests show what device was requested even if deleted
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System handles missing devices without errors

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check PHP syntax
php -l backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/v1/ICTApprovalController.php

# Test specific endpoint (if API is running)
curl -X GET "localhost:8000/api/v1/ict-approval/device-requests"

# Check database relationships
mysql -e "SELECT bs.id, bs.device_type, bs.device_inventory_id, di.device_name, di.is_active 
          FROM booking_service bs 
          LEFT JOIN device_inventory di ON bs.device_inventory_id = di.id 
          WHERE bs.device_inventory_id IS NOT NULL 
          LIMIT 10;"
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Fixed**: ICT approval requests only show active device inventory items  
✅ **Enhanced**: Clear visual indicators for unavailable devices  
✅ **Maintained**: Historical audit trail for deleted devices  
✅ **Improved**: Better user experience with status information  

The fix ensures that ICT officers can clearly see the current status of requested devices and make informed approval decisions.
