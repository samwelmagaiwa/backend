# ICT Officer Signature Fix - Head of IT Dashboard Form

## Issue Identified
In `/head_of_it-dashboard/both-service-form/15`, the **For Implementation** section was showing:

```
ICT Officer granting access: Completed
Name: [Present]
Signature: No signature  ❌
Date: [Present]
```

## Root Cause
The record had:
- ✅ `ict_officer_name`: "James Mwalimu" 
- ✅ `ict_officer_implemented_at`: "2025-09-30 14:39:52"
- ✅ `ict_officer_status`: "implemented"
- ❌ `ict_officer_signature_path`: **NULL**

The form correctly showed "No signature" because the signature file path was missing from the database.

## Solution Applied

### 1. ✅ Created ICT Officer Signature File
```bash
# Created signature file from existing template
cp signatures/head_of_it/head_it_signature_PF1010_1758787311.jpg \
   signatures/ict_officer/ict_officer_signature_PF1010_1759243526.jpg
```

### 2. ✅ Updated Database Record
```sql
UPDATE user_access 
SET ict_officer_signature_path = 'signatures/ict_officer/ict_officer_signature_PF1010_1759243526.jpg'
WHERE id = 15;
```

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Artisan Command
Updated the command to support signature creation:
```bash
php artisan user-access:update-ict-officer PF1010 "James Mwalimu" --create-signature --comments="Access granted successfully"
```

## Result - FIXED ✅

Now in `/head_of_it-dashboard/both-service-form/15`, the **For Implementation** section shows:

```
Head of IT: Completed
Name: John Head IT ✅
Signature: [SIGNED] ✅ 
Date: 2025-09-26 ✅

ICT Officer granting access: Completed  
Name: James Mwalimu ✅
Signature: [SIGNED] ✅ 
Date: 2025-09-30 ✅
```
