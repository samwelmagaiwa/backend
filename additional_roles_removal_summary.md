# Department & Role Assignment Section Removal

## Summary
Completely removed the entire "Department & Role Assignment" section (including both Department dropdown and Primary Role selection) from the Create User modal in the User Role Assignment system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Template Changes
**Removed:** Lines 514-584 (entire Department & Role Assignment section)
- Removed the complete "Department & Role Assignment" section
- Removed Department dropdown with custom positioning logic  
- Removed Primary Role selection dropdown
- Removed all department and role selection functionality
- Removed error handling for department_id and primary_role validation

**Before:**
```html
<!-- Additional Roles Section -->
<div class="bg-white/10 rounded-xl p-6 backdrop-blur-sm border border-blue-300/30 relative z-0">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-4 flex items-center">
    <i class="fas fa-user-tag mr-2 text-blue-300"></i>
    Additional Roles
  </h3>
  <div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-3">
    <!-- Role checkboxes -->
  </div>
</div>
```

**After:** Section completely removed

### 2. Form Data Changes
**Modified:** newUser reactive object
- Removed `department_id: ''` field
- Removed `primary_role: ''` field  
- Removed `availableRoles` and `availableDepartments` reactive arrays
- Removed department dropdown positioning variables

**Before:**
```javascript
const newUser = ref({
  name: '',
  email: '',
  pf_number: '',
  password: '',
  department_id: '',      // REMOVED
  primary_role: ''        // REMOVED
})
const availableRoles = ref([])        // REMOVED
const availableDepartments = ref([])  // REMOVED
```

**After:**
```javascript
const newUser = ref({
  name: '',
  email: '',
  pf_number: '',
  password: ''
})
// availableRoles and availableDepartments completely removed
```

### 3. Form Submission Logic Changes
**Modified:** createUser method
- Removed department_id assignment
- Removed all role assignment logic
- Simplified to only send basic user information

**Before:**
```javascript
const userData = {
  name: newUser.value.name.trim(),
  email: newUser.value.email.trim().toLowerCase(),
  pf_number: newUser.value.pf_number.trim() || null,
  password: newUser.value.password,
  department_id: newUser.value.department_id || null,  // REMOVED
  roles: []  // REMOVED
}
// Role assignment logic removed
```

**After:**
```javascript
const userData = {
  name: newUser.value.name.trim(),
  email: newUser.value.email.trim().toLowerCase(),
  pf_number: newUser.value.pf_number.trim() || null,
  password: newUser.value.password
}
// No department or role assignment
```

### 4. Method Cleanup
**Removed methods:**
- `toggleDepartmentDropdown()` - Department dropdown toggle logic
- `selectDepartment()` - Department selection handler
- `handleClickOutside()` - Click outside handler for dropdown
- `departmentDropdownPosition` computed property

**Modified methods:**
- `openCreateUserModal()` - Removed department/role data loading
- `resetUserForm()` - Removed department and role field resets
- `initializeData()` - Removed availableDepartments/availableRoles initialization

## Impact
- **Drastically Simplified UI:** Create user modal now only contains basic user information
- **No Role/Department Assignment:** Users created without any role or department assignment
- **Eliminated Z-Index Issues:** Removed all dropdown positioning complexities
- **Reduced Dependencies:** No longer needs to load departments or roles data
- **Cleaner Code:** Removed hundreds of lines of dropdown and role management code

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/admin/UserRoleAssignment.vue`
  - Template: Removed complete Additional Roles section (29 lines)
  - Script: Updated form data, submission logic, and reset method (4 locations)

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/admin/user-roles`
2. Click "Create User" button
3. Verify the entire Department & Role Assignment section is completely removed
4. Confirm only the Personal Information section remains (Name, Email, PF Number, Password)
5. Test user creation works with only basic user information
6. Confirm form resets properly without any department/role fields
7. Verify no z-index dropdown positioning issues since all dropdowns are removed
