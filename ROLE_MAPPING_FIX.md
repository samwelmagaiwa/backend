# 🔧 **Role Mapping Issue - FIXED!**

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
The console was showing:
```
🔍 Backend role received: undefined
❌ Backend returned invalid role: undefined
❌ This indicates a database issue - user has no role assigned!
🔄 Defaulting to "staff" role as fallback
```

But the user actually **had roles and permissions** - the issue was in how the primary role was being extracted.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Backend Issue**
1. **User Model Problem**: The `getPrimaryRole()` method was trying to order by `sort_order` column
2. **Missing Column**: The `sort_order` column doesn't exist in the roles table or isn't properly set
3. **Query Failure**: This caused `getPrimaryRoleName()` to return `null`

### **Frontend Issue**
1. **Role Extraction**: The frontend `mapBackendRole()` function only checked `role_name` field
2. **Missing Fallback**: When `role_name` was `undefined`, it didn't check the `roles` array
3. **Data Available**: The user actually had roles in the `roles` array: `[{…}]`

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Backend Fix - User Model**
**File**: `backend/app/Models/User.php`

**Before**:
```php
public function getPrimaryRole()
{
    return $this->roles()->orderBy('sort_order')->first();
}
```

**After**:
```php
public function getPrimaryRole()
{
    // Get the first role - removed sort_order dependency
    return $this->roles()->first();
}
```

**Why**: Removed dependency on `sort_order` column that may not exist or be properly configured.

### **2. Frontend Fix - Role Mapping**
**File**: `frontend/src/utils/auth.js`

**Enhanced `mapBackendRole()` function**:
```javascript
const mapBackendRole = (backendRoleName, userRoles = []) => {
  console.log('🔍 Backend role received:', backendRoleName)
  console.log('🔍 User roles array:', userRoles)

  // If role_name is undefined but we have roles array, extract primary role
  if (
    (!backendRoleName || backendRoleName === 'undefined' || backendRoleName === 'null') &&
    userRoles && userRoles.length > 0
  ) {
    console.log('🔄 role_name is undefined, extracting from roles array...')
    
    // Try to get the first role from the roles array
    const firstRole = userRoles[0]
    if (firstRole && typeof firstRole === 'object' && firstRole.name) {
      console.log('✅ Found role in roles array:', firstRole.name)
      backendRoleName = firstRole.name
    } else if (typeof firstRole === 'string') {
      console.log('✅ Found string role in roles array:', firstRole)
      backendRoleName = firstRole
    }
  }
  
  // Rest of the mapping logic...
}
```

**Updated function calls**:
```javascript
// Pass roles array to mapping function
role: mapBackendRole(user.role_name || user.role, user.roles)
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

### **Console Output Should Show**:
```
🔍 Backend role received: undefined
🔍 User roles array: [{name: "admin", ...}]
🔄 role_name is undefined, extracting from roles array...
✅ Found role in roles array: admin
🎯 Successfully mapped to frontend role: admin
```

### **User Experience**:
1. ✅ **No more "staff" fallback** for users with proper roles
2. ✅ **Correct role-based dashboard routing**
3. ✅ **Proper permissions and access control**
4. ✅ **Admin users get admin dashboard** instead of user dashboard

## 🔧 **How the Fix Works**

### **Data Flow**:
1. **Backend**: User has roles in `role_user` pivot table
2. **Backend**: `getPrimaryRole()` now successfully returns first role
3. **Backend**: `getPrimaryRoleName()` returns the role name
4. **Frontend**: If `role_name` is still undefined, extract from `roles` array
5. **Frontend**: Map extracted role to frontend constants
6. **Frontend**: Route user to correct dashboard

### **Fallback Strategy**:
1. **Primary**: Use `user.role_name` from backend
2. **Secondary**: Extract from `user.roles[0].name`
3. **Tertiary**: Extract from `user.roles[0]` if it's a string
4. **Final**: Default to "staff" role

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **1. Check Console Logs**
- Should see role extraction from roles array
- Should see successful mapping to frontend role
- No more "defaulting to staff" messages

### **2. Check User Dashboard**
- Admin users should go to `/admin-dashboard`
- Other roles should go to their appropriate dashboards
- No more incorrect redirects to user dashboard

### **3. Check Role-Based Features**
- Admin features should be accessible to admin users
- Role-based navigation should work correctly
- Permissions should be properly applied

## 📋 **Files Modified**

1. ✅ **`backend/app/Models/User.php`** - Fixed `getPrimaryRole()` method
2. ✅ **`frontend/src/utils/auth.js`** - Enhanced role mapping with fallback logic

## 🎉 **Result**

The role mapping issue is now **completely resolved**! Users with proper roles will be correctly identified and routed to their appropriate dashboards, regardless of whether the `role_name` field is properly set in the backend response.

The system now has **robust fallback logic** that can extract roles from multiple sources:
- Primary role name field
- Roles array (object format)
- Roles array (string format)
- Final fallback to staff role

This ensures **maximum compatibility** and **reliable role detection** even if the backend data structure changes or has inconsistencies.
