# Head of IT Signature Visibility Fix

## Problem Description
Head of IT users couldn't see their own signature status because the `viewerAfter('head_it')` function returned `false` for Head of IT users themselves. This happened because the function was checking if the viewer's rank was **greater than** the target stage's rank, but Head of IT users are at the **same rank** as the 'head_it' stage.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Logic Issue
The `viewerAfter(stage)` function used this logic:
```javascript
const result = targetRank > 0 && myRank > targetRank
```

### Rank System
```javascript
const ranks = { 
  hod: 1, 
  divisional: 2, 
  ict_director: 3, 
  head_it: 4, 
  ict_officer: 5 
}
```

### The Problem
For Head of IT users checking `viewerAfter('head_it')`:
- `targetRank = 4` (for 'head_it')
- `myRank = 4` (for Head of IT user)
- `result = 4 > 0 && 4 > 4` = **false**

This meant Head of IT users couldn't see their own signature status indicators.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed viewerAfter Function
Changed the comparison from `myRank > targetRank` to `myRank >= targetRank`:
```javascript
// OLD:
const result = targetRank > 0 && myRank > targetRank

// NEW:
const result = targetRank > 0 && myRank >= targetRank
```

This allows users at the same rank or higher to see signature status.

### 2. Enhanced Head IT Signature Visibility
Added explicit fallback logic in the `shouldShowHeadITSignedIndicator()` function:
```javascript
// Explicit fallback: if user is Head of IT and head_it_signature_path exists, show signed
const isHeadOfIt = this.getUserRole()?.toLowerCase() === 'head_of_it' || 
                   this.getUserRole()?.toLowerCase() === 'head_it'
const headItSignatureExists = !!this.requestData?.head_it_signature_path
const fallbackResult = this.isReviewMode && isHeadOfIt && headItSignatureExists

const result = baseResult || fallbackResult
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
Added comprehensive debug logging to help troubleshoot similar issues in the future.

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/views/forms/both-service-form.vue`
  - Line 7942: Changed `myRank > targetRank` to `myRank >= targetRank`
  - Lines 5298-5340: Enhanced `shouldShowHeadITSignedIndicator()` and `shouldShowHeadITNoSignatureIndicator()` with fallback logic

## Impact
- ✅ Head of IT users can now see their own signature status
- ✅ Head of IT users can see if they have already signed a request
- ✅ Head of IT users can see if they still need to sign a request
- ✅ ICT Officers can now see their own signature status
- ✅ ICT Officers can see if they have already signed a request
- ✅ ICT Officers can see if they still need to sign a request
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility for all other roles
- ✅ Added robust fallback logic for edge cases
- ✅ Enhanced debugging for troubleshooting similar issues

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with Head of IT user account
2. Verify signature indicators show correctly for:
   - Requests they have already signed
   - Requests they still need to sign
   - Requests at different approval stages
3. Verify other roles (ICT Officer, ICT Director, etc.) still work correctly

## Extended Solution for ICT Officers
After fixing the Head of IT issue, we discovered ICT Officers had the same problem. Added:

### 4. ICT Officer Signature Indicators
Added dedicated functions similar to Head IT:
```javascript
shouldShowIctOfficerSignedIndicator() {
  const baseResult = this.isReviewMode && this.viewerAfter('ict_officer') && this.hasStageSigned('ict_officer')
  
  // Explicit fallback for ICT Officers
  const isIctOfficer = this.getUserRole()?.toLowerCase() === 'ict_officer'
  const ictOfficerSignatureExists = !!this.requestData?.ict_officer_signature_path
  const fallbackResult = this.isReviewMode && isIctOfficer && ictOfficerSignatureExists
  
  return baseResult || fallbackResult
}
```

### 5. Updated Template Logic
Updated the ICT Officer signature display template to use the new indicator functions.

## Related Issue
This fix resolves the issue where both Head of IT and ICT Officers couldn't see their own signature status because `viewerAfter()` returned false for users at the same rank as the target stage.
