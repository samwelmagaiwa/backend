# BothServiceFormController Corruption Fix

## Problem Summary
The API endpoint `/both-service-form/hod/user-access-requests` was returning a 500 Internal Server Error with the message:
```
Target class [App\Http\Controllers\Api\v1\BothServiceFormController] does not exist.
```

## Root Cause
The `BothServiceFormController.php` file was corrupted and contained ripgrep search statistics instead of actual PHP code:

**Corrupted Content:**
```json
{"data":{"elapsed_total":{"human":"0.030631s","nanos":30630900,"secs":0},"stats":{"bytes_printed":0,"bytes_searched":0,"elapsed":{"human":"0.000000s","nanos":0,"secs":0},"matched_lines":0,"matches":0,"searches":0,"searches_with_match":0}},"type":"summary"}
```

**File Size:** 257 bytes (way too small for a controller)

## Solution
1. **Identified the corruption** - The file contained search statistics instead of PHP code
2. **Recreated the controller** - Restored the `BothServiceFormController.php` with proper PHP code
3. **Verified the fix** - File size increased to 12,899 bytes (normal size)

## Files Fixed
- `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/v1/BothServiceFormController.php` - Completely recreated

## Controller Methods Restored
- `getUserInfo()` - Get user information for auto-population
- `getPersonalInfoFromUserAccess()` - Get personal information from user_access table
- `getUserAccessRequestsForHOD()` - Get user access requests for HOD/Divisional Director approval
- `getDepartments()` - Get departments list

## Key Features
- **Role-based access control** - Supports both HOD and Divisional Director roles
- **Department filtering** - Users only see requests from their assigned department
- **Comprehensive logging** - Debug information for troubleshooting
- **Error handling** - Proper exception handling and user-friendly error messages

## Expected Result
The endpoint should now work correctly and return user access requests for approval by HOD and Divisional Director users.

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Login as a user with HOD or Divisional Director role
2. Make a GET request to `/both-service-form/hod/user-access-requests`
3. Should receive a 200 response with user access requests data

## Prevention
This type of corruption suggests that the file was accidentally overwritten during a search operation. To prevent this:
- Be careful when using search tools that might write to files
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Use version control to track file changes
