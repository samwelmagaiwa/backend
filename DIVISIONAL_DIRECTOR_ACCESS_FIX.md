# Divisional Director Access Fix

## Problem Summary
A divisional director user was getting a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to access the `/both-service-form/hod/user-access-requests` endpoint with the error:
```
syntax error, unexpected token "=>"
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Syntax Error in BothServiceFormController
**File**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/v1/BothServiceFormController.php`
**Issue**: Missing section in the `getFormForHOD` method around line 827 caused a syntax error
**Fix**: Removed duplicate/incomplete array section

### 2. Role Access Restriction
**Issue**: The endpoint was restricted to HOD users only, but divisional directors also need access
**Fix**: Extended access to both HOD and Divisional Director roles

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Syntax Error
**File**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/v1/BothServiceFormController.php`
**Lines**: Around 827-835
**Change**: Removed incomplete array section that was causing syntax error

```php
// BEFORE (causing syntax error)
'dict_section' => [
    'approval_status' => $form->dict_approval_status,
    'comments' => $form->dict_comments,
    'approved_at' => $form->dict_approved_at,
    'approved_by' => $form->dictUser?->name,
    'can_edit' => false,
    'is_readonly' => true
],

    'can_edit' => false,  // ← This was causing the syntax error
    'is_readonly' => true
],

// AFTER (fixed)
'dict_section' => [
    'approval_status' => $form->dict_approval_status,
    'comments' => $form->dict_comments,
    'approved_at' => $form->dict_approved_at,
    'approved_by' => $form->dictUser?->name,
    'can_edit' => false,
    'is_readonly' => true
],
```

### 2. Extended Role Access
**File**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/v1/BothServiceFormController.php`
**Method**: `getUserAccessRequestsForHOD`

**Changes**:
- Updated method documentation to reflect support for both roles
- Modified role check to allow both `head_of_department` and `divisional_director`
- Enhanced department lookup logic to handle both HOD and Divisional Director assignments
- Updated debug logging and error messages

```php
// BEFORE
if (!array_intersect($userRoles, ['head_of_department'])) {
    return response()->json([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Access denied. Only HOD can access this endpoint.'
    ], 403);
}

// AFTER
if (!array_intersect($userRoles, ['head_of_department', 'divisional_director'])) {
    return response()->json([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Access denied. Only HOD and Divisional Director can access this endpoint.'
    ], 403);
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Department Lookup
**Logic**: Added support for finding departments based on user role:
- **HOD**: Find department where `hod_user_id = current_user_id`
- **Divisional Director**: Find department where `divisional_director_id = current_user_id`

### 4. Updated Route Middleware
**File**: `backend/routes/api.php`
**Change**: Modified middleware to accept both roles

```php
// BEFORE
->middleware('both.service.role:hod')

// AFTER
->middleware('both.service.role:hod,divisional_director')
```

### 5. Enhanced Middleware Support
**File**: `backend/app/Http/Middleware/BothServiceFormRoleMiddleware.php`
**Enhancement**: Added support for comma-separated roles in middleware parameters

```php
// NEW FEATURE: Support comma-separated roles
$requiredRoles = explode(',', $requiredRole);

$allowedForRoute = [];
foreach ($requiredRoles as $role) {
    $role = trim($role);
    if (isset($roleMapping[$role])) {
        $allowedForRoute = array_merge($allowedForRoute, $roleMapping[$role]);
    }
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ **For HOD Users**:
- Can access `/both-service-form/hod/user-access-requests`
- See requests from their assigned department
- All existing functionality preserved

### ✅ **For Divisional Director Users**:
- Can now access `/both-service-form/hod/user-access-requests`
- See requests from their assigned department
- Same interface and functionality as HOD

### ✅ **Error Resolution**:
- No more syntax errors
- No more 500 Internal Server Error
- Proper role-based access control

## Testing Verification

To verify the fix:

1. **Login as Divisional Director**
2. **Navigate to requests dashboard**
3. **Confirm no 500 errors**
4. **Verify requests are loaded from correct department**

## Debug Information

The enhanced logging will show:
- User roles and department assignments
- Department lookup process
- All departments with their HOD and Divisional Director assignments

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**:
- All existing HOD functionality preserved
- No changes to existing API contracts
- No frontend changes required
- Existing middleware behavior maintained for single roles

## Security Considerations

✅ **Security maintained**:
- Users can only see requests from their assigned department
- Role-based access control enforced
- No privilege escalation possible
- Proper authentication and authorization checks

## Future Enhancements

Consider these improvements:
1. **Rename endpoint** to be more generic (e.g., `/approval/user-access-requests`)
2. **Create role-specific endpoints** for clearer separation
3. **Add role-based filtering** in the response data
4. **Implement department-based permissions** for more granular control
